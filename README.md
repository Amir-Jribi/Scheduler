# Scheduler
Implemented several scheduling algorithms in C++ including Round Robin, FIFO (First In, First Out), and SJF (Shortest Job First), each aimed at optimizing task execution efficiency.
Utilized priority queues to enhance the implementation of the SJF algorithm, ensuring tasks were processed in the most efficient order.
